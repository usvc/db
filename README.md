### On Github

Github is used to deploy binaries/libraries because of it's ease of access by other developers.

#### Releasing

Releasing of the binaries can be done via Travis CI.

2. Click on **Generate new token**, give the token an appropriate name and check the checkbox on **`public_repo`** within the **repo** header
3. Copy the generated token
4. Navigate to [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) and access the cooresponding repository there. Click on the **More options** button on the top right of the repository page and select **Settings**
5. Scroll down to the section on **Environment Variables** and enter in a new **NAME** with `RELEASE_TOKEN` and the **VALUE** field cooresponding to the generated personal access token, and hit **Add**

### On Gitlab

Gitlab is used to run tests and ensure that builds run correctly.

#### Version Bumping

1. Run `make .ssh`
2. Copy the contents of the file generated at `./.ssh/id_rsa.base64` into an environment variable named **`DEPLOY_KEY`** in **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**
3. Navigate to the **Deploy Keys** section of the **Settings > Repository > Deploy Keys** and paste in the contents of the file generated at `./.ssh/id_rsa.pub` with the **Write access allowed** checkbox enabled

- **`DEPLOY_KEY`**: generate this by running `make .ssh` and copying the contents of the file generated at `./.ssh/id_rsa.base64`

#### DockerHub Publishing
